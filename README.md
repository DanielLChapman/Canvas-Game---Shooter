This is based on a youtube video I had recommended, that I can not find otherwise I would link it (if you know what it is, send me a message so I can please give credit), where it had randomized shooters in a grid and it let it run. Thought it would be a fun thing to do and to play around with detection with respect to searching arrays. 

It used plinko-like options for each player to determine which it did (+2, fire, or x2), wasn't sure the best way of going about that so I built everything with vanilla canvas js and just randomized what happened. When it was all done I started looking on codepen for plinko solutions and I stumbled upon [this codepen by Alan Chu](https://codepen.io/Alan_Chu/pen/bKaYye).

He built this codepen based on a coding challenge by Daniel Shiffman

I thought it was an interesting solution, never experienced Matter.js or p5 so was fun to experience it and how well it runs especially with large amount of particles and collision on a physics engine. So I adapted it to this project and added it as a switch under settings / about.
Also threw in a way to switch the plinkos around and letting you drop your own so you can completely ignore the shooter part and just have fun with plinkos!
